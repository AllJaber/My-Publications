## Abstract
Haemophilus ducreyi, a gram-negative bacterium, is known to cause chancroid, a sexually transmitted disease characterized by genital ulcers. This study conducted a comparative analysis of ten draft genomes isolated from children with cutaneous lesions in Vanuatu and Ghana against a reference strain. The analysis revealed genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense, including unique genes that could serve as novel drug or vaccine targets. Notably, genes for mercuric ion reductase and mercury resistance operon regulatory protein were found in some isolates but not in the reference strain.

## Methods
1. **Sequence Retrieval and Alignment:** The reference strain Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HP and draft genomes from Vanuatu and Ghana were aligned using the MAUVE tool.
2. **Similarity Comparison:** BRIG was used to visualize genome similarities.
3. **Genome Assembly and Annotation:** RAST was employed for annotation, revealing significant genes related to virulence.
4. **Identification of Prophage and CRISPRs Regions:** PHASTER and CRISPRFinder identified prophage and CRISPR regions, indicating gene gain/loss.
5. **Phylogenetic Analysis:** MEGA and iTOL were used to construct and visualize phylogenetic trees.

## Results
- **Alignment:** Visualization showed homologous regions and genome rearrangements.
- **Gene Identification:** Functional comparison identified genes related to antibiotic resistance and virulence, including those unique to the isolates.
- **Prophage and CRISPRs:** These regions were analyzed to understand their role in genetic diversity and evolution.
- **Phylogenetics:** The analysis provided insights into the genetic relationships and evolutionary history of the strains.

## Conclusion
The study enhances the understanding of Haemophilus ducreyi's genetic basis for virulence and antibiotic resistance, offering potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
