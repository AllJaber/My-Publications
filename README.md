## Abstract
Haemophilus ducreyi, a gram-negative bacterium, is known to cause chancroid, a sexually transmitted disease characterized by genital ulcers. This study conducted a comparative analysis of ten draft genomes isolated from children with cutaneous lesions in Vanuatu and Ghana against a reference strain. The analysis revealed genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense, including unique genes that could serve as novel drug or vaccine targets. Notably, genes for mercuric ion reductase and mercury resistance operon regulatory protein were found in some isolates but not in the reference strain.

## Methods
1. **Sequence Retrieval and Alignment:** The reference strain Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HP and draft genomes from Vanuatu and Ghana were aligned using the MAUVE tool.
2. **Similarity Comparison:** BRIG was used to visualize genome similarities.
3. **Genome Assembly and Annotation:** RAST was employed for annotation, revealing significant genes related to virulence.
4. **Identification of Prophage and CRISPRs Regions:** PHASTER and CRISPRFinder identified prophage and CRISPR regions, indicating gene gain/loss.
5. **Phylogenetic Analysis:** MEGA and iTOL were used to construct and visualize phylogenetic trees.

## Results
- **Alignment:** Visualization showed homologous regions and genome rearrangements.
- **Gene Identification:** Functional comparison identified genes related to antibiotic resistance and virulence, including those unique to the isolates.
- **Prophage and CRISPRs:** These regions were analyzed to understand their role in genetic diversity and evolution.
- **Phylogenetics:** The analysis provided insights into the genetic relationships and evolutionary history of the strains.

## Conclusion
The study enhances the understanding of Haemophilus ducreyi's genetic basis for virulence and antibiotic resistance, offering potential targets for therapeutic interventions.

## Abstract
This study investigates the inhibitory potential of amiloride analogs against the SARS-CoV-2 E protein using molecular docking and dynamics simulations. The E protein is crucial for viral assembly, release, and pathogenesis. Amiloride analogs, particularly hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) and 3A5NP2C, showed higher binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 E compared to SARS-CoV-1 E. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that these compounds could alter the native structure and flexibility of the E protein, suggesting their potential as effective inhibitors.

## Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, posing a significant global health threat. The virus encodes small envelope protein (E) which plays a key role in viral assembly and host inflammation. This study explores the inhibitory effects of amiloride analogs on the E protein of SARS-CoV-2.

## Methods
1. **Protein Characterization:** BLASTp was used to identify homologous sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. The sequences were analyzed using ProtParam, Pfam, and other tools.
2. **3D Structure Generation:** E proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 were modeled and refined using various computational tools.
3. **Pharmacokinetics of Ligands:** The properties of HMA and 3A5NP2C were explored using SWISS-ADME and PubChem.
4. **Molecular Docking:** AutoDock tools were used for docking simulations to evaluate ligand-receptor interactions.
5. **Molecular Dynamics Simulations:** Simulations were performed to study the dynamics and stability of ligand-bound E proteins in a lipid bilayer environment.

## Results
- **Protein Characterization:** SARS-CoV-2 E protein has a higher theoretical pI and instability index compared to other coronaviruses.
- **Binding Affinity:** HMA and 3A5NP2C showed higher binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 E than SARS-CoV-1 E, engaging more amino acids.
- **Structural Alterations:** Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that these ligands could significantly alter the structure and flexibility of the E protein, particularly in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions.

## Conclusion
The study suggests that amiloride analogs, especially HMA and 3A5NP2C, might be effective inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein, making them potential candidates for developing COVID-19 therapeutics.

## Abstract
B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) gene, which encodes Bcl-2 protein, is vital for apoptotic programmed cell death. In this study, computational approaches were performed to reveal the effect of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in Bcl-2 gene. A total of 79 nsSNPs were studied. Amongst all, 11 nsSNPs (M166T, G141E, R129C, S105P, F104S, R98L, L97P, H94P, V93A, G27S, V15L) were located at highly conserved regions or functionally important domains with a high probability of being deleterious for the protein function. These mutations were further investigated for their effect on the stability and binding affinity of the Bcl-2 protein.

## Methods
1. **Sequence Retrieval and Alignment:** The Bcl-2 gene sequences were retrieved and analyzed using computational tools to predict the impact of nsSNPs.
2. **Stability Analysis:** The stability of the protein structures with and without nsSNPs was assessed using molecular dynamics simulations.
3. **Binding Affinity Assessment:** The binding affinity of the mutated proteins with the HA 14-1 antagonist was evaluated using docking simulations.

## Results
- **High-risk nsSNPs Identification:** Out of 79 nsSNPs, 11 were identified as high-risk due to their location in conserved or functional domains.
- **Structural Stability:** Most high-risk nsSNPs resulted in decreased stability of the Bcl-2 protein structure, except H94P.
- **Binding Affinity:** The F104S mutation significantly reduced the binding affinity to HA 14-1 compared to the wild type.

## Conclusion
This study highlights the potential impact of high-risk nsSNPs on the structural stability and function of the Bcl-2 protein, providing insights for future research and therapeutic strategies.
